# An Evaluation of Unity ML-Agents Toolkit for Learning Boss Strategies.

A repository for the Unity project implemented where there is a learning agent (Boss) that learns the best use of the actions given for winning in a battle against a non-learning agent (Player).

The project had two focuses: a) To compare the learning provided by the different algorithms included in Unity’s Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) Toolkit, and additionally compare the use of the Imitation Learning algorithms as complements of the Reinforce Learning algorithm, and; b) Test the usability of the ML-Agents Toolkit by creating a learning environment to train an agent and compare my experience implementing and training such an agent with the information provided by Unity’s documentation.
